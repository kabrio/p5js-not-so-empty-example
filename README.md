# p5js-pretty-empty-example
Can be used as a starting point for p5js sketches.

This is similar to the original p5js empty example but features a few practical changes and add ons.

p5.gui.js lib included 

Using p5 version 0.5.11 because above is not compatible with p5.gui.js.

colorMode set to HSB.

ellipseMode and rectMode set to CENTER.

angleMode set to DEGREES.

windowResized function included to enable resizing of canvas/sketch. 

Draws point in middle of canvas for testing purpose.
